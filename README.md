# EDA on Air Quality Dataset 
Exploratory Data Analysis Assignment using Air Quality Dataset

## Dataset Information
The dataset used for this analysis, taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository, contains the responses of a gas multisensor device deployed on the field in an Italian city. Hourly responses averages are recorded along with gas concentrations references from a certified analyzer.

Data were recorded from March 2004 to February 2005 (one year)
